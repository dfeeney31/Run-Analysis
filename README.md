# Run-Analysis
Run analysis for force data obtained on a treadmill. This can be modified for a variety of purposes,
but it calculates peak loading rates, medial/lateral, and breaking/propulsive forces and ensemble averages them.
This requires some additional functions added in here that are not written by me (histf.m for example).
